SHMIG_TEST
=================

Automated tests for [`shmig`](https://github.com/mbucc/shmig/blob/master/shmig).

To run manually, clone this project, copy shmig into this directory, start
docker, and run ./test_runner.sh.  To test a single platform, comment out
lines in test_runner.conf before running test_runner.sh.  Then check 
stderr.actual and stdout.actual.  You can also use "DEBUG=1 ./test_runner.sh" 
to get more output from the test script.
